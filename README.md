There a lot of things that I could add, but 3 hours is not a very big amount of time.
For example:
- pagination + caching
- coredata to store images
- Accessibility
- UI Tests
- play with design
- first request make about position where user is (if he approves to share his coordinates)
- add app icons
- add sound after image was downloaded
- disable save button
- change background to one of images from list
- 1000 others good and not so good ideas
